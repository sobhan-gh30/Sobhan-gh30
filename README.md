## Hi there! I'm Mohammad Ghasemi (aka Sobhan)! 😄

I'm a Front-end developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional web applications. I have experience working with CSS frameworks like TailwindCss and Bootstrap, which help me design responsive and visually appealing interfaces.💻<br>
Currently, I'm learning popular JavaScript frameworks like React and Next.js, while also expanding my knowledge in back-end development as a student. 🔭✨<br>
In addition to my front-end skills, I am proficient in PHP and Python, and I'm currently learning the Laravel framework to enhance my back-end capabilities. 🛠️❤️<br>

I also create content on my YouTube channel, where I share programming tips, coding tutorials, and sometimes a glimpse into my personal life. My goal is to help others learn and grow in the field of software development. 📹🌱<br>
Feel free to check out my projects and connect with me! 🤗💬
